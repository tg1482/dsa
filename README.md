# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Repo to host code for learning and practice for Data Structures and Algorithms.

Learning Data Structures from:
* Prof Joshua Hug: UC Berkeley in his very popular class [CS 61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es/)
* Practice questions on Leetcode

Learning Algorithms from:
* Prof Tim Roughgarden: Stanford University from his online class on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRM3sc57q0c&list=PLXFMmlk03Dt7Q0xr1PIAriY5623cKiH7V)

I'll be adding solutions online to try and help others in their journey to becoming an advanced professional in Data Science and Machine Learning. There are a lot of resources online but most of them do not have the correct solution and it might get overwhelming to try and find solutions to all the problems in one place. This strives to be a one-stop-shop for all (as a develop my knowledge and this repo further)

Thank you! I hope you like my solutions.
